### Personal & business qualities:

- **Compliance with deadlines.**  I work with the GULP project builder, which allows me to speed up the plan. I know how to allocate my time between tasks correctly and profitably.
- **Decision-making.** Qualitatively I develop adaptive layout based on PC layouts, which saves a lot of time and budget and does not require or order additional design layouts.
- **Attention to detail.** If the TOR does not take into account some points, I myself, based on experience, predict the logic of a particular element of the layout. Minimum of questions, maximum results.
- **Self-learning and Googling skills.** All the time I was learning on my own. I searched for information, worked through it and practiced. For me there is no "can't do" or "don't know. I don't wait for people to come and explain. I find a solution and implementation of any task, thereby learning and improving my skills.
