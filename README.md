### Working with me you save:

- **Money.**  I qualitatively develop adaptive layout based on PC layouts, which saves your budget significantly and does not require ordering additional design layouts.
- **Time** to write the terms of reference. I am sure that you can not take into account all the TOR, because I myself, based of experience, predict the logic of a particular element of the layout. Minimum questions, maximum results.
- **Nerves.** Requests and revisions of non-structural nature are already included in the cost of work! So if you missed a number of small things in the design, they will be made to the layout at your request, without unnecessary disputes and additional costs!

### Warranty on the layout:

Within a week after the transfer of the archive with the finished layout I free and immediately correct my mistakes that might have been missed in the process of obtaining work and noticed later.
